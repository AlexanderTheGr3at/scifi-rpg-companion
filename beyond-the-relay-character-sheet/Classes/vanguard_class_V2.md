- **Cost:** None
- **Range:** 12 hexes
- **Targeting:** Single enemy within line of sight
- **Effect:** You instantly teleport to an enemy, appearing in an adjacent hex. Deal 1d8+2+Biotics damage. If target has no active kinetic barriers, biotic barriers, or armor, they are **Knocked Prone**. If target has any protection, they are **Staggered** (lose next Move Action only). You restore 5 Kinetic Barrier points regardless of hit/miss.
- **Special:** Must teleport to adjacent hex to target.

**Uses per Mission:**
| Biotics Attribute | Uses |

### Ammo Training
- **Cost:** None (Combat Action to switch)

- **Effect:** Can switch between ammo types. Each type modifies all weapon attacks:
  - **Incendiary Ammo:** Weapon damage becomes fire-type and ignores 3 armor points (only applies when hitting armor directly, after kinetic barriers and biotic barriers are depleted).
  - **Cryo Ammo:** Weapon damage becomes cold-type. Against unprotected targets (no active kinetic barriers or biotic barriers), applies **Slowed** for 2 turns.
- **Special:** Represents hybrid combat training from military background
