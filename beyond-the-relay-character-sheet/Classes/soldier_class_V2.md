## Class Features

**Weapon Mastery** - Choose one weapon type at creation (Assault Rifle, Sniper Rifle, Shotgun, etc.). Gain +1 damage with that weapon type permanently.

**Heavy Weapons Training** - Can use Heavy Weapons and still move at half speed (most classes cannot move at all).

**Soldier Training** - Only Soldiers can use the extra shot available on certain weapons (marked as "Soldier: +1 shot" in weapon descriptions). Each shot past the first adds a stacking -2 to hit penalty.

**Ammo Specialization** - Can spend a Combat Action to switch between ammo types. Each type modifies all weapon attacks until changed:

- **Incendiary Ammo:** Weapon damage becomes fire-type and ignores 3 armor points (only applies when hitting armor directly, after kinetic barriers and biotic barriers are depleted).
- **Disruptor Ammo:** Weapon damage becomes electrical-type and deals double damage to kinetic barriers and synthetic enemies.
- **Cryo Ammo:** Weapon damage becomes cold-type. Against unprotected targets (no active kinetic barriers or biotic barriers), applies **Slowed** for 2 turns.

**Starting Equipment:**
- **Credits:** 5,000 to spend on gear
- **Free Class Bonus:** Basic Heavy Pistol (M-3 Predator, worth 400 credits)
- **Mandatory Gear:** Environmental suit, emergency medkit (no cost)

**Suggested Equipment Purchases:**
