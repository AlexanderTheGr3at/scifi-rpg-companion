# Beyond the Relay - Character Creation Rules

*Building heroes for galactic adventures*

---

## Ability Scores

Each character is rated in the following ability scores:

- **Evasion**: Determines how hard a character is to hit during combat
- **Speed**: Indicates movement distance in hexes (or grid spaces) on the tabletop
- **Combat Skill**: Adds to attack dice rolls
- **Health**: How hardy the character is. Each point in Health gives the character 5HP. This stat determines the amount of damage the character can withstand before being incapacitated
- **Charisma**: Covers charm, leadership, and influence (used mainly outside battles)
- **Biotics**: The ability to manipulate dark energy and create mass effect fields through electrical impulses from the brain. Each Point in Biotics gives the character 5 Biotic Energy
- **Tech**: Powers based around engineering or hacking various technologies. Each Point in Tech gives the character 5 Tech Points

**Character Advancement:** The character may gain 20 levels. Each level grants 1 skill point to spend on Ability scores. No ability score can be improved past 10 unless by gear or other effects.

## Crew Composition

You can start with a crew of up to 4 members. Their races can be selected by you, randomized based on the Race Table below, or a mixture of the two. New crew members can be recruited along your journey if you desire (or need a new member due to the RNG gods killing your innocent team!).

### Race Table

Roll to determine the species of each crew member:

| Roll (1d100) | Race |
|---------------|------|
| 1-10 | Human |
| 11-20 | Asari |
| 21-30 | Turian |
| 31-40 | Krogan |
| 41-50 | Salarian |
| 51-60 | Quarian |
| 61-70 | Drell |
| 71-80 | Batarian |
| 81-90 | Vorcha |
| 91-100 | Volus |
