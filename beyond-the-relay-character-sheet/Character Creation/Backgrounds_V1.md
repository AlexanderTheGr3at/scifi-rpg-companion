## Background Integration Guidelines

### Using Race-Specific Backgrounds
- **Any race can choose any background** (Generic backgrounds work for everyone)
- **Race-specific backgrounds are suggested** for thematic authenticity but not required
- **Mix and match** - a Human could have Quarian Pilgrimage if they grew up on the Fleet

### Faction Reputation Stacking
- **Multiple characters** with the same faction bonus don't stack
- **Conflicting backgrounds** create interesting squad tension
- **GM discretion** on how conflicting loyalties affect missions

### Campaign Integration
- **Background events** can be rolled during downtime
- **Story hooks** provide ready-made plot threads
- **Special benefits** should feel meaningful but not overpowered

---

## Design Philosophy

**Narrative Foundation:** Backgrounds provide character motivation and galaxy connections without overlapping class mechanics.

**Mechanical Distinction:** Each background offers a unique campaign-relevant ability that rewards different attribute investments.

**Cultural Authenticity:** Race-specific backgrounds reflect genuine Mass Effect lore and cultural practices.

**Player Choice:** System supports both deliberate character creation and random generation for variety.
