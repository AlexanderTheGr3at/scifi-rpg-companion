# AI Hacking -- Tier 2 Tech Power

**Base Cost:** 7 TP  
**Range:** 12 hexes  
**Targeting:** Single synthetic enemy within line of sight  
**XP Cost:** 75 XP

---

**Effect:**  
You inject malicious code into synthetic systems to override their programming. Make a Tech vs. Evasion attack roll against a synthetic enemy:
- **On hit target takes:**
  - **Dominated** for 2 turns (vs. unprotected synthetics) - target acts as your ally
  - **Dazed** for 1 turn (vs. protected synthetics) - cannot use abilities or powers, may still move and make basic attacks
  - **Immobilized** for 2 turns (vs. Combat Drones) - completely disabled

**Special:**  
- Synthetics only - cannot affect organic enemies
- Cannot affect enemies with active Kinetic Barriers or Biotic Barriers (barriers absorb all effects)
- Level restriction: cannot target synthetic enemies with level higher than your Tech attribute
- Only one enemy may be dominated at a time

**Quick Cast Compatibility:**  
- Can be combined with other Tier 1 or Tier 2 powers using Quick Cast rules
- Cost becomes 8 TP when Quick Cast
- Both powers suffer -2 to hit when Quick Cast
- Works well with Overload to strip barriers first, then dominate
