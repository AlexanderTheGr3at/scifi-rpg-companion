**Effect:**  
You deploy neural disruption omni-fabricated restraint field. Target must make an Evasion Check (2d6 + Evasion) vs. your Tech DC (10 + Tech):
- **On failure:** Target is **Netted** for 4 turns (cannot move, cannot use abilities requiring movement, -4 to all attack rolls)
- **Neural Interference:** **Netted** target takes 1d4+Tech electrical damage at start of each turn from neural disruption
- **Additional:** Each time a **Netted** target attempts any action, they must make Evasion Check vs. Tech DC or be **Stunned** for 2 turns
- **On success:** Target is **Slowed** for 3 turns instead

**Special:**  
- Advanced restraint technology with neural disruption systems
- Cannot affect enemies with active Kinetic Barriers or Biotic Barriers (barriers absorb all effects)
- **Netted** targets can attempt to break free by spending Combat Action and making Evasion Check vs. Tech DC
- Allies must spend Combat Action to free netted targets
