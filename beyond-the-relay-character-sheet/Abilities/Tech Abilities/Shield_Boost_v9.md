**Base Cost:** 4 TP  
**Range:** 8 hexes

**XP Cost:** 65 XP

---

**Effect:**  
You enhance kinetic barrier systems through remote optimization. Automatically succeeds (no roll required):

**Special:**  
- Can target self
- Does not work on characters without kinetic barrier systems
- Auto-success reflects direct technological interface rather than attack

**Quick Cast Compatibility:**  
- Can be combined with other Tier 1 or Tier 2 powers using Quick Cast rules
- Cost becomes 5 TP when Quick Cast
- Other power suffers -2 to hit (doesn't affect Shield Boost as it auto-succeeds)
