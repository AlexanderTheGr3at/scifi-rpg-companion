# Submission Net -- Tier 3 Tech Power

**Base Cost:** 12 TP  
**Range:** 12 hexes  
**Targeting:** Single enemy within line of sight  
**XP Cost:** 130 XP

---

**Effect:**  
You deploy an advanced omni-fabricated restraint field that captures and immobilizes a priority target. Target must make an Evasion Check (2d6 + Evasion) vs. your Tech DC (10 + Tech):
- **On failure:** Target is **Immobilized** for 3 turns and suffers additional restraint penalties (cannot use abilities requiring movement, -3 to all attack rolls, allies must spend Combat Action to free them)
- **On success:** Target is **Slowed** for 2 turns instead

**Special:**  
- Advanced restraint technology fabricated through omni-tool
- Cannot affect enemies with active Kinetic Barriers or Biotic Barriers (barriers absorb all effects)
- **Immobilized** targets can attempt to break free by spending Combat Action and making Evasion Check vs. Tech DC
- Single-target precision allows focused control of priority enemies

**Quick Cast Compatibility:**  
- **Cannot be Quick Cast** - Tier 3 powers are designed as standalone ultimate moments requiring full tactical focus

## Level 15 Upgrades (Specialty) -- 28 TP | 124 XP

### Permanent Restraint Protocol
Adds permanent capture technology to your Level 15 effect. **Immobilized** targets cannot attempt to break free on their own - only allies can free them by spending a Combat Action and making a Tech Check vs. difficulty 15. Additionally, if any **Immobilized** target is reduced to 0 HP, they are automatically stabilized at 1 HP and remain **Immobilized** (allowing for capture rather than elimination).
