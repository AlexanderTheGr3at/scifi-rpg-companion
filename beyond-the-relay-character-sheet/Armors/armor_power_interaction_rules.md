# Beyond the Relay - Armor & Power Interaction Rules

*How armor choices affect biotic and tech power efficiency*

---

## Heavy Armor Power Penalties

Characters wearing Heavy armor suffer interference with biotic and tech abilities due to the armor's bulk and integrated systems disrupting precise power manipulation. The more advanced and protective the armor, the greater the interference.

### Power Cost Increases

**Heavy Armor Tiers:**
- **Tier I Heavy Armor:** All biotic and tech powers cost **+1 additional BE/TP**
- **Tier II Heavy Armor:** All biotic and tech powers cost **+2 additional BE/TP**  
- **Tier III Heavy Armor:** All biotic and tech powers cost **+3 additional BE/TP**

**Minimum Cost Rule:** Power costs cannot be reduced below 1 BE/TP regardless of penalties or bonuses.

**Light and Medium Armor:** No power cost penalties.

## Tactical Impact Examples

### Biotics 5 Character (25 BE Total)

**Standard Power (5 BE base cost):**
- **Light/Medium Armor:** 5 BE cost = 5 uses per mission
- **Tier I Heavy:** 6 BE cost = 4 uses per mission
- **Tier II Heavy:** 7 BE cost = 3 uses per mission
- **Tier III Heavy:** 8 BE cost = 3 uses per mission

**Advanced Power (8 BE base cost):**
- **Light/Medium Armor:** 8 BE cost = 3 uses per mission
- **Tier I Heavy:** 9 BE cost = 2 uses per mission
- **Tier II Heavy:** 10 BE cost = 2 uses per mission
- **Tier III Heavy:** 11 BE cost = 2 uses per mission

### Tech 8 Character (40 TP Total)

**Standard Power (4 TP base cost):**
- **Light/Medium Armor:** 4 TP cost = 10 uses per mission
- **Tier I Heavy:** 5 TP cost = 8 uses per mission
- **Tier II Heavy:** 6 TP cost = 6 uses per mission
- **Tier III Heavy:** 7 TP cost = 5 uses per mission

## Build Archetypes

### "Tank Builds"
- **Tier III Heavy Armor:** Maximum protection, minimum power usage
- **Strategy:** Focus on a few high-impact powers, rely on weapons/abilities
- **Best For:** Defensive specialists, frontline support

### "Balanced Builds"  
- **Tier I-II Heavy Armor:** Good protection, moderate power efficiency
- **Strategy:** Mix of powers and durability, tactical flexibility
- **Best For:** Hybrid specialists, versatile operatives

### "Power Builds"
- **Light/Medium Armor:** Minimum protection, maximum power efficiency
- **Strategy:** Heavy reliance on powers, stay mobile and protected
- **Best For:** Pure specialists, backline controllers

## Design Philosophy

This system ensures that:
- **Every armor choice has meaningful trade-offs**
- **Power specialists naturally prefer lighter armor** (optimal efficiency)
- **Tank builds remain viable** for power users (but at a resource cost)
- **No arbitrary restrictions** prevent player choice
- **Tactical depth increases** as gear tier progresses

*"The most advanced armor provides unparalleled protection, but its bulk and interference systems make precise biotic and tech manipulation significantly more challenging."*
