## Design Notes

### Tier Progression Philosophy
- **Tier 1:** Basic enhancement, 100-500 credits, accessible early game
- **Tier 2:** Significant improvement, 375-1,500 credits, mid-game power spike
- **Tier 3:** Elite enhancement, 900-3,000 credits, late-game optimization

### Passive vs. Active Benefits
- **Passive bonuses** provide consistent improvement throughout mission
- **Special effects** create dramatic moments and tactical flexibility
- **Once per mission** limitation prevents ability spam while maintaining impact

### Power Synergies
- **Omni-tools** enhance tech power effectiveness and versatility
- **Biotic amps** amplify biotic power damage and control
- **Specialized amps** reward focused character builds (Charge, Warp, etc.)
- **Generic amps** (L-series) provide flexible enhancement for any build

### Balance Considerations
- **Cost scales with power** - elite gear provides significant advantages
- **Manufacturer variety** creates meaningful equipment choices
- **Special effects** create memorable tactical moments without breaking balance
- **Stacking rules** prevent excessive power from multiple sources
