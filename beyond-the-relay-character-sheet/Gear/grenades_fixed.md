*Tactical utility grenades for battlefield control and specialized damage*

---

## Grenade Mechanics

### Basic Rules
- **Action Cost:** Item Action (same as healing items)
- **Range:** 12 hexes (thrown weapons)
- **Targeting:** Choose impact point, effects radiate from there
- **Inventory:** Grenades count as equipment items (3 total equipment limit per mission)
- **Procurement:** Purchase with credits or find as mission rewards

### Throw Mechanics
- **Accuracy:** 2d6 + Combat vs. difficulty based on range:
  - **Close (1-4 hexes):** Difficulty 8
  - **Medium (5-8 hexes):** Difficulty 10
  - **Long (9-12 hexes):** Difficulty 12
- **Scatter:** On miss, grenade scatters 1d3 hexes in random direction
- **Cover:** Grenades ignore cover bonuses (thrown over obstacles)
- **Line of Sight:** Requires clear throwing path to target hex
- **Kinetic Barriers:** Shields absorb grenade damage normally (Mass Effect fields deflect/slow projectiles)
