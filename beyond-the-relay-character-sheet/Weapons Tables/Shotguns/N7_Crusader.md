*The N7 Crusader represents a radical departure from traditional shotgun design, firing a single high-velocity slug instead of multiple pellets. This Alliance special forces weapon combines rifle-like precision with shotgun stopping power, capable of punching through cover and armor with devastating effect. The weapon's four-shot capacity and semi-automatic fire rate make it ideal for sustained precision engagements, though its specialized design requires careful ammunition management.*
