*The Venom Shotgun is a grenade launcher masquerading as a conventional firearm. This weapon fires explosive rounds rather than pellets, creating devastating area effects that can clear entire rooms of enemies. The weapon's dual firing modes allow tactical flexibility - quick explosive shots for immediate threats or charged bombardments for maximum devastation. However, its substantial weight and poor long-range accuracy limit its tactical applications.*
