*The Alliance military's standard-issue shotgun, the Katana prioritizes magazine capacity and ease of manufacture over performance. While its five-shot capacity provides sustained firepower, the weapon's poor balance and basic construction make it a entry-level option. Popular among new recruits for its reliability and simplicity, though most upgrade as soon as possible.*
