## Weapon Description

The N7 Valkyrie represents the evolution of precision assault rifle design - a semi-automatic burst-fire weapon that delivers controlled two-round bursts with exceptional accuracy and ammunition efficiency. Each trigger pull fires exactly two rounds in rapid succession, but the weapon cannot be held on full-auto, requiring disciplined fire control. This design philosophy prioritizes accuracy and sustainability over raw rate of fire.
