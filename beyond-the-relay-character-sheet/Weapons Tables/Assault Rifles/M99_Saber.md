## Weapon Description

The M-99 Saber represents the pinnacle of assault rifle damage potential, functioning essentially as a designated marksman rifle. This viciously powerful weapon delivers more damage per shot than any other assault rifle through precision engineering and high-powered ammunition. While sacrificing rate of fire for raw stopping power, the Saber excels at long-range precision engagements where every shot must count.
