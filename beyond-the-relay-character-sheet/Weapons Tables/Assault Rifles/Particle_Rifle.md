## Weapon Description

The Particle Rifle represents a revolutionary return to self-cooling weapon technology, firing a concentrated particle beam that requires no thermal clip management. While initial beam intensity is modest, sustained fire on the same target causes exponential damage escalation as particles accumulate and destabilize molecular bonds. The weapon's perfect accuracy and unlimited ammunition make it ideal for sustained engagements against priority targets.
